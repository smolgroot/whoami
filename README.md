# Whoami - Geo IP Blocking website

**Whoami** is a simple Go HTTP server providing a "What's my IP?" service.
You can use it for testing purpose to see if your IP address is effectively hidden behind a VPN or a Proxy (HTTP, SOCKS, etc.).

The app is serving a "fake" video streaming website called *Netblix*, which is known to geo-IP-block some of its content.
